lightroom-integration
=====================

#Workflow integration extensions for Adobe Lightroom
This is a sample integration on how you can automate the flow between Netlife RetouchLink and Adobe Lightroom. The integration is built around two Lightroom plugins, one for import and one for export.
The plugins are made with help from the Lightroom SDK. For information about how to create Lightroom plugins, visit [Lightroom Developer Center](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshoplightroom.html).
